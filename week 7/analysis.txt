NOTE:
- Your time complexities should be expressed in big-O notation and be in
  terms of n, where n is the number of cells in the maze.

============
  solveBfs
============

- Worst case time complexity: O(V + E)

- Explanation: it will explore every vertex and edge. The number of vertices in the graph is V, while the edges are E.

============
  solveDfs
============

- Worst case time complexity: O(V + E)

- Explanation: it will explore every vertex and edge. The number of vertices in the graph is V, while the edges are E.
