Question 3

(a) How many times (exact number) is the statement in line 3 executed 
    (initialization of components)?

    n

(b) How many times (exact number) is the statement in line 6 executed 
    (deleting an edge from the list of edges)?

    m

(c) What is the time complexity (in big-O notation) of testing whether
    two nodes are in different components?

    O(n)

(d) In the worst case, how many times (exact number) is the statement in
    line 8 executed (merging two components)? Justify your answer.

    m - 1

(e) What is the worst case time complexity (in big-O notation) of
    merging two components into a single component? Justify your answer.

    O(n)

(f) What is the overall worst case time complexity (in big-O notation)
    of this algorithm? Ignore the complexity of lines 1 and 4. Justify
    your answer.

    O(n)
